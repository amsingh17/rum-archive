There are at least 3 ways you can contibute to the RUM Archive:

1. If you're interested in sharing your own RUM data, please consider releasing it in the same format as the RUM Archive!
    * Any individual, website, organization or RUM provider should be able to generate aggregated RUM data in the same
        [format](/docs/methodology) as described in this project.
    * Each dataset will bring its own unique view of RUM data, and contribute to the diversity of data available through the project.
    * Please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/rum-archive/rum-archive/issues) to describe the RUM data you'd like
        to make available.

2. The RUM Archive project and documentation is open source!  If you'd like to contribute, please see the
   [Github project](https://github.com/rum-archive/rum-archive).

3. If you use any RUM Archive data in your research, talk, or any other project, please link back to us!
