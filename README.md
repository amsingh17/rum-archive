# RUM Archive (beta!)

The **RUM Archive** is a publicly available and [queryable](/docs/querying) dataset of anonymized Real User Monitoring (RUM) page loads
and resource fetches.

Taking inspiration from projects like the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org) and the [HTTP Archive](https//httparchive.org),
we aim to make RUM data available for researchers to analyze trends in market share and performance analytics.

Want to query this data?  Check out the [documentation](/docs) for details on how to access it.

Interested in contributing your own RUM data to the public dataset?  Read the [contributing guide](/contribute) for more details.
